 browser choses the last one it sees
 between the rules coming from the same source
 (dafault / user agent / author style sheets)
 so that's why grey is applied to paragraph and not green

 this applies to the order of the link tags in the
 document in the case that the style rules are
 coming from different css files. Styles in the last one
 overrides the previous one

 ordering behaaviour is the last style rule wins
